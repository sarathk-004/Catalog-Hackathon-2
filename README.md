## Crop and Soil Management System
> Farmers face several challenges related to crop selection, soil management, disease identification and
other factors, which can impact agricultural productivity and sustainability. To address these challenges,
we need an application to help farmers for full-fledged farming.

### Overview
It is a console-based application designed to assist farmers with key  aspects of farming, including crop 
selection, soil management, and disease identification. This application  aims to improve agricultural 
productivity and sustainability by providing intelligent recommendations based on user inputs.

1. Crop Selection
    1) Input: Soil type, climate, season.
    2. Output: Provides crop recommendations with planting times and expected yields.
    3. Intelligent Response: If an exact match isn't found, the system collects additional data (water availability, market demand) and provides alternative crop suggestions.

2. Soil Management
    1. Input: Soil pH level, nutrient level.
    2. Output: Offers recommendations for soil treatment, including adjusting pH levels and fertilization tips.
    3. Intelligent Response: Tailored recommendations based on the specific conditions of the soil.

3. Disease Identification
    1. Input: Crop type, observed symptoms.
    2. Output: Diagnoses potential diseases and suggests appropriate treatments.
    3. Intelligent Response: If the disease isn't identified, the system gathers more information (spread rate, affected parts) and offers advice on general crop health or suspected issues.
